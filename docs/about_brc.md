## What is this?

Blender Render Controller is a tool to help speed up the rendering of Blender's Video Sequence Editor (VSE) projects.

VSE is pretty good for editing videos, it's precise and relatively easy to learn, making it a compelling choice next to other free video editing tools. There are some downsides too, main of which been that the renderer is **single threaded**. Meaning that it won't take full advantage of all logical cores in your system, so rendering your finished project is **super slow** compared to other video editors.

This tool offers a work-around for this limitation until the Blender developers make a better renderer for VSE. 

It renders different segments (chunks) of the project at the same time by calling multiple blender.exe instances, **making use of full processing power of your PC**.
After all parts are rendered, they're joined together in FFmpeg, and your **video is ready much faster** then previously possible.

## How much difference does it make?
**Quite a lot!** I did some testing shown below (Blender Render Controller shown in orange):

PC used: i7 4790, 16GB DDR3 RAM @ 1600Mhz

Really shows the importance of those extra cores huh? And of course, more processor cores = bigger difference.
Even if you don't use Blender VSE often, thatâ€™s a LOT of time saved. And the time added by joining the videos together is negligible (less then 1min).
