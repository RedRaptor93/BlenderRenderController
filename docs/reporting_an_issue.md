If you found a problem or a bug, feel free to post about it in the [issues](https://github.com/RedRaptor93/BlenderRenderController/issues) tab. But before you do:

1. Check the Known issues section in the Readme.md
2. Make sure you're using the [latest version](https://github.com/RedRaptor93/BlenderRenderController/releases/latest)
3. Try deleting the settings file and restart BRC.

When writing your report, make sure to mention your project settings (codecs, framerate, etc) as well as describing the problem it self.
